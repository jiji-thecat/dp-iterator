# Design Pattern - Iterator pattern

## Description

![iterator](https://github.com/jiji-thecat/dp-iterator/assets/104809324/629b8b16-5dd7-4cf6-bbf9-74a062905933)

The Iterator pattern is a design pattern used to easily iterate or provide access to a set of data. For example, suppose you have the following datasets:

- 3 items of Animal type stored in a std::vector.
- 3 items of Animal type stored in a std::list.
- 3 items of Animal type stored in a double array.

Traditionally, accessing data from these datasets requires writing three different methods. For a std::vector, you would access it via `vector[index]`, but std::list does not support this, so you would need to use a pointer. However, by following the Iterator pattern, implementing a simple iterator will allow for easy access.

The datasets will utilize the Aggregate class, while the accessor will employ the Iterator class as an interface.
